Odoo User Activity Dashboard

This module will aim to track user activity in realtime for a stats dashboard inside Odoo for tracking the behaviour of Odoo users. This could be used for tracking users page visits, page visit duration, ip address, country, interaction with various parts of the website frontend and portal, etc.

Eventually this could be used to track other custom user interactions for employees as well as customers.
